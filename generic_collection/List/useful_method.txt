Important methods of generic list collection class in C#:
The Generic List in C# provides a lot of useful methods that we can use to perform some operations on a collection of List Type. 
The List Collection class provides the following functions.

Contains() Method:
The Contains() method is used to determine whether the specified item exists or not in the list. If the specified item exists 
then it will return true else return false.

Exists() Method:
The Exists() method is also used to check or determine whether an item exists or not in a list based on a condition.
If the item exists then it will return true else it will return false.

Find() Method:
The Find() method is used to find the first element from a list based on a condition that is specified by a lambda expression.

FindLast() Method:
The FindLast() method is used to searches for an element that matches the conditions specified by a predicate. 
If it found any elements with that specified condition then it returns the Last matching element from the list.

FindAll() Method:
The FindAll() method is used to retrieves all the elements from a list that matches the conditions specified by a predicate. 

FindIndex() Method:
The FindIndex() method is used to return the index position of the first element that matches the conditions specified by a predicate. 
The point that you need to remember is the index here in generic collections are zero-based. This method returns -1 if an element that 
matches the specified conditions is not found. There are 2 other overloaded versions of this method is available, one of the overload 
version allows us to specify the range of elements to search within the list.

FindLastIndex() Method:
The FindLastIndex() Method searches for an element in the list that matches the condition specified by the lambda expression and 
then returns the index of the last occurrence of the item within the list. There are 2 other overloaded version of this method is 
available, one of the overload version allows us to specify the range of elements to search within the list.
